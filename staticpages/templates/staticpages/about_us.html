    <br/>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Iâ€™ve Been Found (IBF) is an online lost and found service currently in phase 1 development. We understand how losing possessions is a universal human experience. We believe that people who find lost items will invest time and effort to see the item returned to its owner. We want to meet that need and encourage that community-based action through effective technology development.</p>
